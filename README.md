# FRC-Cpp-Course
A basic introduction to C++ intended for Curtin FRC teams

## Intentions
The decisions made in creating this activity were made for a particular purpose. It is here that these decisions are elucidated for the good of the instructor. If the instructor understands the intent of the exercise, then he/she will be better suited to conduct the exercise.

The main goals of the course are to:
 - Teach computation: Software engineering is an interesting discipline in-and-of itself, but it's particular methods do not differ much from that of other engineering disciplines. Students will gain an appetite for the rigour and thought of engineering from other activities that heavily focus on process.

 This activity intends to provide insight into that which is unique to computing. Algorithms and the coercion of data this takes first position here.
 - Be entertaining: Attributes of the exercise that fail to satisfy the first (above) criteria, are (usually) in service of this criteria. There are tedious tasks in computing, as there are in any field. An attempt has been made to relate the tasks being completed to tasks that may be useful, or otherwise interesting, for the participants.

- Be achievable: Students coming in can only be assumed to have a certain competency level. Some knowledge of C++ is required to complete these tasks. If a reasonable amount of knowledge is required, then this will be emphatically noted.






In this stream you will develop an in-depth knowledge of software design and algorithm analysis, as well as artificial intelligence, computer communications, databases and graphics. Your study will focus on the knowledge required to build operating systems and design new programming languages. As computer science theory and applications are mathematically based, there is a strong emphasis on mathematics.

# Code Formatting
C++ is a case sensitive language. Case sensitivity means that your keywords and variable declarations must match the case. For example, a C++ keyword for a constant type is const. If you were to type Const or CONST, the compiler would not know that your intention was to use the keyword const.

Aside from the case sensitivity, C++ also has a defined outline for program code and specific "elements" found in a typical C++ application. These elements consist of:

Preprocessor directives which are used to have the compiler execute tasks prior to compiling the source code
using directives which are utilized to indicate which namespaces to include in a source code file
a function header which consists of a return type, function name, and parameters
a function body containing the code that performs the actions required of that function
statements that are contained in the C++ source code file
comments for documenting the source code for programmers to understand what the code is intended to do
a return statement that sends data back to the function caller
curly braces to enclose bodies of statements. Commonly used to denote the body of a function or a flow controls statement such as a for loop

# Cpp Statements
A C++ program is comprised of various components such as functions, methods, classes, etc. The instructions that form part of a C++ program typically reside inside of functions or methods. These functions are comprised of C++ statements. You will find yourself using various types of statements in your C++ code as listed here:

declarations - these are used to declare variables and constants that will be used in your application
assignments - these are used to assign values to variables in your application code
preprocessor directives - covered in the topic on Code Formatting
comments - used to document your code
function declarations - covered in the topic on Code Formatting
executable statements - these are used to perform operations and execute instructions. Examples would be cout << "Hello World!"; which outputs Hello World! to the console.
You will use these statement types throughout this and successive courses on C++.
